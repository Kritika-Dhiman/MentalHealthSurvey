The Comprehensive Personal Profile (CPP) form, an integral component of this project, is designed using C++ to gather relevant information for the purpose of mental health assessment. The information sought through this form includes:

1.	User's Name
2.	Age
3.	Gender
4.	State 
5.	Country
6.	Level of education
7.	Family history of mental health issues (Yes/No)
8.	Any current medical treatment for mental health (Yes/No)
9.	Work interference of mental health (Low/Medium/High)
10.	Experience of trigger points (Yes/No)
11.	Average sleep hours
12.	Coping strategies if any
    
Following the user's completion of the form, the collected data is displayed, and the system provides tailored coping strategies. These strategies may encompass techniques such as deep breathing, engaging in physical activities, improving sleep habits, and encouraging communication with others.

Additionally, the CPP form conducts a comprehensive mental health assessment by generating anxiety scores, depression scores, and stress scores. Based on this assessment, the system offers recommendations regarding the necessity of seeking professional assistance. This feature contributes to the overall efficacy of the platform in promoting mental well-being and facilitating appropriate intervention when required.
